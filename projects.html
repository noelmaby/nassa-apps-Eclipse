                <span class="project-title">How do eclipses occur ?</span>
                <p class="project-description">
                  Eclipses happen when the Sun, Moon, and Earth line up in a special way.
                   Imagine playing with your toys - sometimes one toy blocks the light 
                   from another toy. In a solar eclipse, the Moon is like the toy that covers
                    the Sun for a little while. It's like the Sun is taking a short nap. In a 
                    lunar eclipse, it's the Earth that stands between the Sun and the Moon,
                     making the Moon look a bit dark or sometimes turning it into a beautiful
                      red color. Eclipses are like nature's amazing shows in the sky, making 
                      our world even more exciting to explore!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span class="project-title">Why do only some people on Earth see an eclipse at a given time ?</span>
                <p class="project-description">Eclipses are like amazing sky shows, but they don't happen
                   everywhere at the same time. It's a bit like a fantastic magic trick that only a few
                    lucky people can watch up close. Imagine you have a big, yummy ice cream cone, and 
                    you can only share it with your friends who are standing right next to you. Eclipses
                     work kind of like that. For a solar eclipse, it's because the Moon's shadow is small,
                      so only people in that shadow can see the eclipse. And for a lunar eclipse, it depends
                       on where the Moon and Earth are in the sky. So, it's like a special treat for those who
                        are in the right place when the magic happens, but there will be more chances to see these
                         sky surprises in the future!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span class="project-title">What causes the Sun, Moon, and Earth to align?</span>
                <p class="project-description">The Sun, Moon, and Earth like to move around in the sky, and sometimes
                   they line up in a straight line, just like when you and your friends stand in a line for a game. 
                   This special line-up is what makes eclipses happen. It's a bit like when you and your friends make a 
                   straight line to take turns or play a fun race. When the Sun, Moon, and Earth get all lined up, they
                    create the shadowy magic that turns the day into night for a little while during a solar eclipse or
                     changes the Moon's color during a lunar eclipse. It's like a cosmic game of "ready, set, go" that
                      happens high up in the sky!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span class="project-title">How often do eclipses occur?</span>
                <p class="project-description">Eclipses are super cool, but they don't happen all the time. It's a bit 
                  like having your favorite dessert; you can't have it every day. Solar eclipses, when the Moon covers 
                  the Sun, happen around once or twice a year somewhere on Earth. So, you might need to wait a little 
                  while to see one where you live. Lunar eclipses, when the Earth's shadow makes the Moon look different,
                   also happen a few times a year, but not everyone can see them because it depends on where you are on Earth.
                    But don't worry, even though eclipses are a bit rare, they are always amazing surprises when they do happen!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span class="project-title">How do scientists know when and where eclipses will occur?</span>
                <p class="project-description">Scientists are like cosmic detectives who study the movements of the Earth, Moon, and Sun.
                   They use special tools, like telescopes and computers, to figure out when and where eclipses will happen. It's a bit 
                   like playing with a big puzzle. They know that the Moon goes around the Earth, and the Earth goes around the Sun, so 
                   they can predict when these three friends will line up in the sky. That's when an eclipse can occur. They make eclipse
                    schedules, like your school schedule, to tell us when and where we might see these fantastic sky shows. So, thanks to 
                    scientists, we can plan to watch these exciting events and learn more about our amazing universe!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span class="project-title">What is the difference between a lunar and solar eclipse?</span>
                <p class="project-description">Lunar and solar eclipses are like two different kinds of sky surprises. In a lunar eclipse, 
                  the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, and the Moon looks a bit dark or even turns red. It's like the Earth gives 
                  the Moon a cozy blanket for a little while. But in a solar eclipse, the Moon stands between the Earth and the Sun, and the
                   Sun disappears for a bit, making the sky go dark during the day in certain places. So, in a lunar eclipse, we see changes 
                   on the Moon, and in a solar eclipse, we see changes in the sky here on Earth. They're like two special games the sky likes
                    to play with us!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="project-title">What is an eclipse season and why do they occur approximately every six months (or twice a year)?</span>
              <p class="project-description">An eclipse season is a bit like a special time when the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun get all lined up 
                more often. It's like having two chances to see cool sky shows in just one year. You know how the Moon goes around the Earth? Well,
                 sometimes it's a bit tilted, like how you lean when you play games. This tilt makes eclipse seasons. Imagine you have a special spinning
                  top, and when you spin it, it wobbles a little. During eclipse seasons, the Moon's wobble makes it easier for the Earth, the Moon,
                   and the Sun to line up and create eclipses. So, we get to see these amazing sky surprises about twice a year. It's like a bonus gift
                    from the sky!</p>
